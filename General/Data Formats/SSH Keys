we decoded the ssh key into pem and put it into a new file using the ssh-keygen -f bruce_rsa_6e7ecd53b443a97013397b1a1ea30e14.pub -e -m PEM > pubkey.pem command
then we exctracted the modulus as a hex using the >openssl rsa -pubin -inform PEM -in pubkey.pem -noout -modulus command on the new .pem file so the openssl can indetify it
and then we converted the modulus from hex format to binary
